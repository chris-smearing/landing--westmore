# Demo of landing page for Westmore Beauty

This code represents a version of the Shopify template that I created for Westmore Beauty. While it doesn't include Liquid syntax, it does demonstrate my ability to create responsive styling for page elements.

Includes Flexslider, lazy loading images, Font Awesome icons, and embedded YouTube players. Also included in the main JS file are functions used in the checkout flow, which was used on a page which opened from the Order Now buttons.
